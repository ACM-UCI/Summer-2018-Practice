2018 Summer Practice for ACM@UCI
================================

Repo for all problems solved/unsolved during summer practice for ACM@UCI in
2018.

Files ending in .txt are input files; files ending in .cpp, .py, etc. are code
files.

Each directory has a directory for solved and unsolved problems. Unsolved is for
problems that you struggled to solve and could not solve, or that you want us to
solve in the future.
